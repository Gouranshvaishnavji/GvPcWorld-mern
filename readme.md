# ðŸ“… GV PC WORLD
Unlocking the power of Personalization

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi, my name is Gouransh Vaishnav and this is Gvâ€™s Pc World '''
.........
My project is a website where you can build your own computer! You can sign up, log in, and pick out all the parts you need, like the brain (CPU), heart (GPU), and memory (RAM) for your Dream Pc. It will show you the prices in real time!. And if you're someone who sells computer parts, you can join too! You can add your stuff to sell and let people know when something's out of stock. There's also a special area where the boss (admin) keeps an eye on things and helps if there are any problems. I made this website to show off what I've learned about Full Stack Development and to help people build awesome computers!

Why I chose this..
Shopping for PC parts can be time-consuming, especially when comparing prices across different websites. Your app can provide real-time pricing from various sellers, making it easier for users to find the best deals

Landing Page / Home Page:

- The landing page serves as the entry point to the GV PC World website.
- It features an attractive layout with high-quality images showcasing various PC components and systems.
- The page includes a prominent search bar for users to quickly find specific products.
- Key features and benefits of the website are highlighted, such as personalized PC building, competitive pricing, and seller options.
- Call-to-action buttons encourage users to explore products, sign up, or log in.


Login Page :

The login page for sellers provides access for registered sellers to manage their product listings and inventory.
Similar to the buyer login page, it includes fields for entering email and password.
Authentication features, such as captcha or two-factor authentication, may be implemented for added security.
New sellers can find links to register for a seller account if they don't have one already.
After successful login, sellers are directed to their dashboard or product management interface.


PC Building / Product Selection Page:

This page allows users to browse and select PC components for building custom systems.
Product categories, such as CPUs, GPUs, motherboards, RAM, storage, and peripherals, are displayed for easy navigation.
Filters and sorting options enable users to refine their search based on criteria like price, brand, compatibility, and popularity.
Each product listing includes detailed specifications, images, user reviews, and pricing information.
Users can add selected items to their shopping cart for purchase or comparison.


Seller Dashboard / Product Management Page:

This page is accessible to registered sellers for managing their product listings and inventory.
Sellers can add new products, update existing listings, set prices, and adjust inventory quantities.

Support resources and help documentation may be available to assist sellers in managing their accounts effectively
